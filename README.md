# Emotion-Detection-using-Keras
The goal of this project is to build a decent emotion detector using the Extended Cohn Kanade Images Dataset by leveraging the inherent capabilities of VGG-Face(VGG16) to recognize facial features.

We use transfer learning to train our model with the help of pre trained weights available for VGG-Face in Keras.

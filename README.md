# Emotion-Detection-using-Keras
The goal of this project is to build a decent emotion detector using the Extended Cohn Kanade Images Dataset by leveraging the inherent capabilities of VGG-Face(VGG16) to recognize facial features.

We use transfer learning to train our model quickly with the help of pre-trained weights available for VGG-Face in Keras.

<b>Target Emotions-<b>
1) Happy
2) Sad
3) Angry
4) Neutral
5) Surprise
6) Fear
7) Disgust

Dataset-
Training images = 764
Testing images = 217
